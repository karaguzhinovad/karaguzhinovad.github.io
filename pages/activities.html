         <h3>MUN</h3>
         <div class="price">Model United Nations is an academic simulation of 
            the United Nations where students play the role of delegates from different 
            countries and attempt to solve real world issues with the policies and perspectives of their assigned 
            country. For example, a student may be assigned the United Kingdom and will have to solve 
            global topics such as nuclear non-proliferation or climate change from the policies and perspectives of the United Kingdom.</div>

      <h3>AIESEC</h3>
      <p>AIESEC for me is a place to discover my own potential 
         and become the best version of myself. Indeed, communicating 
         and working with members get the tremendous motivation to move forward, 
         achieve more, and learn something new. For me, the support that I receive from 
         the people from our organization also plays an important role, it is something that 
         helps me to believe in myself, and I really appreciate that. AIESEC is a big family, AIESEC is about people.

      <h3>MUN</h3>
      <p>Presenting thoughts out of classroom settings made fear that I was doing something 
         wrong to disappear. I was delighted to be part of the MUN community, primarily 
         because of how conferences were planned. Some time later, it was decided to organize 
         the same event at the school where I study. Watching the experience of my schoolmates and me 
         through social networks, a large number of people from our city began 
         to show interest because this type of activity had never been conducted in our city before. 
         That is why we invited students from all over the region. I have been in charge of organizing the 
         regional Model United Nations Conference in which I was also a chair of the committee “Economic and Social Council”.</p>

      <h3>Voluntering</h3>
      <p>The experience taught me empathy, compassion, and teamwork. Working with people whom you've never
          met before can be intimidating at times , but it helped me strengthen my communication skills and grow as a person. 
         It helped build character and leadership, moulding me into a more patient and responsible individual.</p>
